The IoT-based crop suitability testing device is needed for precise and efficient methods of assessing soil conditions for agricultural purposes.
The device consists of sensors for measuring key soil parameters such as pH level, moisture content, temperature.
These sensors are connected to a microcontroller unit that processes the data and transmits it to database. The platform analyzes the data using our own code to determine the suitability of the soil for various crops.
Farmers can access this information through a user-friendly interface on the display.
It provides real-time monitoring, allowing farmers to make informed decisions promptly. Additionally, it reduces the need for manual labor and minimizes the risk of human error.
The IoT-based crop suitability testing device represents a significant advancement in agricultural technology, addressing the growing need for precise and efficient methods of assessing soil conditions for optimal crop growth.


Traditional soil testing methods have often been time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lacking in real-time monitoring capabilities.
This innovative device combines sophisticated sensors with IoT technology to provide farmers with instant and accurate information regarding the suitability of soil for specific crops.
One of the primary advantages of the IoT-based crop suitability testing device is its ability to provide real-time monitoring of soil conditions.
Moreover, by reducing the need for manual labor and minimizing the risk of human error, the device streamlines the soil testing process, saving time and resources for farmers.
Overall, the integration of IoT technology into crop suitability testing represents a significant step forward in precision agriculture.

Based on the analysis, suitable crops for cultivation can be displayed on LCD that is compatible with Arduino.
Precision agriculture, increased yield, remote monitoring and management are some of the benefits of this IOT device.
